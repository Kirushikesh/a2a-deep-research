## The Architecture

1. A Local MCP Server with all the required tools.
2. A Multi Agent System developed using CrewAI that acts as a √Å2A Server and uses the tools from MCP.
3. An A2A Client that can be used to interact with the Multi Agent System, which can be simple Langgraph tool calling agent.
4. An UI may be a simple streamlit app that user can use to interact with the A2A Client.

### Steps

1. Identify a potential usecase
2. Identify the tools required for the usecase
3. Identify the multi-agents required for the usecase
4. Implement the MCP Server
5. Implement the A2A Server which consumes the MCP Tools.
6. Implement the A2A Client.
7. Implement the UI.(Use the demo app code from the A2A repo)
8. Test the system.


### Next to Do:

1. Currently the UI with A2A client is working with ADK based google agentic framework.
2. The Backend is running with CrewAI based multi agent system of image generation.
3. The MCP server integration with the CrewAI is actually not working, not sure whats the issue, the MCP server itself is not starting.

4. Change the Google ADK in the frontend to langchain simple react based framework. -- its too difficult
5. Change the CrewAI backend to the text based task with text based tool using within file tool. -- I changed it to langgraph
6. Move the CrewAI tool to within to outside like to a MCP Server. -- Done for the langgraph
7. Once the above points are reached, pick up a usecase, of two agent communication or multi-agent framework, or agentic pattern from langgraph or crewai, possibly crewai so that we can take the blind code from there. Move that new problem statement into the A2A server and serve it using the Langgraph based A2A client.

### External:
1. Publish the work to github.
2. Write a substack blog for this work.
